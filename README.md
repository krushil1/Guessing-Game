# Guessing-Game 

Write a program that plays a guessing game with the user. The program should generate a
random number between 1 and some maximum (such as 100), then prompt the user repeatedly
to guess the number.
When the user guesses incorrectly, the game should give the user a hint about whether the
correct answer is higher or lower than the guess. Once the user guesses correctly, the
program should print a message showing the number of guesses that the user made.
Once you have this program working correctly, extend the program by making it play multiple games until the user chooses to stop.

Sample Output:
**************Let’s Play a Guessing Game! ****************
The computer has chosen a number between 1 – 100.
Enter your guess: 50
Too High!
Enter your guess: 25
Too Low!
Enter your guess: 37
Correct! You got it in 3 guesses!
Play again? Enter (Y/N):
